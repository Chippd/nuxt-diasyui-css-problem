AIhairstyles can generate a new hairline for you. Are you balding, or just curious? Perhaps you want to see what you'd look like with a different hairline. AIhairstyles can help.

## How to use AI to generate a new hairline
By default, AIhairstyles will try to detect your current hairline and generate a hairstyle based on that hairline. This is because normally, you want to maintain your existing hairline when generating AI hairstyles for yourself. 

However, maybe you're curious what you'd look like with a different hairline. Maybe you've got a receding hairline and are considering a hair transplant, or perhaps a hair system. 

Well, AIhairstyles can help. Simply upload a photo of yourself, and then check the "Generate new hairline" checkbox before generating a hairstyle. AIhairstyles will then generate a new hairline for you. 

Do note, though, that some styles that naturally have a frigne or bangs will cover the hairline. The ideal styles to see the new hairline are those that are slicked back or have a quiff, like crew cut, pompadour, or slicked back styles.
